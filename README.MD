I've created a comprehensive README.md file for the DentalSync project. The readme includes:

2. Technology stack details
3. Installation instructions
4. Project structure
5. Development setup guide
6. User roles and permissions
7. Contributing guidelines
8. Security information

Would you like me to adjust any section or add more specific information to any part of the readme?
